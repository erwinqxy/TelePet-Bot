## Inspiration ðŸ¤”ðŸ’­
The COVID19 pandemic has limited the frequency of human interactions. People seem to interact less with one another. And yet people are not talking to one another frequently enough, groups get incredibly foreign and awkward over time. Group Was you ever in a position where group chats are incredibly silent and awkward? Unsure what you are doing there? Were you ever in a telegram group chat that just got less active over time? We hope CinnaBoys, a telegram bot for group chats can help bridge the gap within the virtual domain and bring people closer through simple prompts, memes, and laughter. 


## What it does ðŸ¦¾
CinnaBoys addresses aim to target the Most Entertaining Hack. 
1. Telegram group can become rather inactive and quiet. CinnaBoys aims to spark social conversations. 
2. Telegram groups can become rather dull and lifeless. CinnaBoys uses Computer Vision to manipulate photos, stickers, and gifs with "meme" overlays that we promise will make you laugh. 
3. Telegram groups can get quite boring with walls of text. CinnaBoys uses Tiktok API to get random TikTok videos and the bot will send these videos in the group chat. Users can even request TikTok videos at their fingertips.

The backend is written in Python, with  <credits>


Database: We used google sheets API to store pet information for each group chat.


## Challenges we ran into
- JF decided to play dota and sleep 

- Encoder formats for opencv videowriter may not be compatible for different Operating Systems (Windows vs Mac), resulting in some generate videos 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are quite happy that we managed to use classical machine learning methods (haar cascade) for face detection and achieve a high accuracy for frontal faces in different forms of media (images, stickers and gifs).



## What we learned ðŸŽ“ 
1. Using Git and GitHub 
    - We ran into many conflicts while trying to sync our changes together, working with unfamiliar APIs, but with a fair bit of googling and endurance, we managed to pick up a few important pointers to take note of when working with other developers
    - To help with the syncing of our changes on GitHub, we also learnt to use VSCode Live Share to work together as well. This turned out to be surprisingly useful since we were unable to meet up in real life to work on the project together
2. Working in a team 
    - To help with the syncing of our changes on GitHub, we also learnt to use VSCode Live Share to work together as well. This turned out to be surprisingly useful since we were unable to meet up in real life to work on the project together
3. APIs
    - We gained familiarity with using a variety of natural language APIs while we were sourcing for a suitable candidate for our application, and also had some fun along the way!
    - In addition, we had to work with a variety of AWS-related APIs to bring our solution together and we learnt about the risks of managing API keys securely.
4. Error Handling
